This thermostat provides an optimal control of an air solar ventilation and a single heated zone to reduce the primary energy needs by 30 to 60 %. Connected to your local network, an embedded Webserver provides an user-friendly interface accessible by most browsers from a computer or a mobile device.  The heating needs can be scheduled for 7 days by the web interface.  For user applications, two temperature sensors and one relay can be remotely monitored and controlled.
