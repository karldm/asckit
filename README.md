Air Solar Controller - Kit for arduino yun

## Overview
This thermostat provides an optimal control of an air solar ventilation and a single heated zone to reduce the primary energy needs by 30 to 60 %. Connected to your local network, an embedded Webserver provides an user-friendly interface accessible by most browsers from a computer or a mobile device.  The heating needs can be scheduled for 7 days by the web interface.  For user applications, two temperature sensors and one relay can be remotely monitored and controlled.
## Specifications
- External Micro-USB plug or any regulated power supply 5V/2A
- Main heater controlled by a single relay (SPDT – single latch 5V coil - 250VAC—10A)
- Air solar ventilation controlled by a relay (SPDT – single latch 5V coil - 250VAC—10A) *
- One user-controlled relay (SPDT – single latch 5V coil)
- Two numerical temperature sensors for user applications (-50/+125 °C)
- Heated zone measurement accuracy (DHT22 sensor) [temperature +/- 0.2 °C, humidity +/- 1%]
- Network connection by Wifi or Ethernet cable
- Embedded Webserver (Linino on Arduino Yun)
- REST requests format for parameters access (compatible with most modern Home Automation systems)
* the thermostat may be used without an air solar ventilation, in that case it is a classical single zone thermostat
